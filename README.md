Focus spells are not automatically added to the character. If you need to know what your selection for the Yorishiro heirloom is, you can double check by opening the Yorishiro class feature, clicking details, and then edit ChoiceSelect rule element. Your choice will be at the bottom line of text.
In order for traits and spells to properly appear in the compendium, you will need to manually add the Kannagi trait to foundry. You can do this by going to Game Settings -> Configure Settings -> Pathfinder 2nd Edition -> Homebrew Elements -> add Kannagi to spell and feat traits.
